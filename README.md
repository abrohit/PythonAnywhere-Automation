## About the Project

Setting up and running a website on pythonanywhere is easy and takes little to no time. However, maintaining the web app and ensuring it runs forever is a pain. Hence, this script solves it. With the free tier PythonAnywhere you can run one task/script daily.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Selenium

## Behind the Project

The class [Automate()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L8) from [main.py](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py) breaks the process into three parts [login()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L28), [webapp()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L43), and [tasks()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L50). The [run()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L57) method runs these three functions and [quit()](https://github.com/abrohit/PythonAnywhere-Automation/blob/main/main.py#L64) quits the Selenium driver.
